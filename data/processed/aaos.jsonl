First, the Petitioner must demonstrate that she is a member of an association in her field.

The Director's decision noted that in response to the RFE, the Petitioner provided a letter from the organization, Professional Women Association \"One Hundred Georgia Woman\" reflecting the Petitioner has been an association member since 2018.

While she argues and submits evidence for one additional criterion on appeal relating to performing in a leading or critical role at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(h)(3)(viii), it is unnecessary that we make a decision on this additional ground because she cannot numerically meet the required number of criteria.

The Petitioner seeks a highly restrictive visa classification, intended for individuals already at the top of their respective fields, rather than for individuals progressing toward that goal.

This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in their field through extensive documentation.

In his brief: the Petitioner presents many ofthe same arguments he did in his response to the Director's RFE, asserting that the field of media and communication is an interdisciplinary field which includes art. We note that when responding to the RFE, the Petitioner included a page from the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), published by the BLS, which listed \"media and communication\" as one of several occupation groups. However, a list of the occupations in this broad group does not include artists such as painters, which are included under the \"arts and design\" occupational group.

As the Petitioner cannot fulfill the initial evidentiary requirement of meeting at least three of criteria under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(h)(3), the identified basis for denial is dis positive of the appeal. We therefore reserve the Petitioner's appellate arguments regarding this additional evidentiary criterion. See INS v.

The Petitioner seeks a highly restrictive visa classification, intended for individuals already at the top of their respective fields, rather than for those progressing toward the top.

Further regarding the Petitioner's reliance on unpublished AAO decisions, we note that while our precedent decisions are binding on users, unpublished decisions are not similarly binding. See 8 e.F.R. \u00a7 103.3(c). In addition, the Petitioner has not established that the facts of this petition are analogous to those in the unpublished decision. For instance, the Petitioner cites the circulation data provided in the unpublished decision, asserting that we deemed those numbers as sufficient to \"surpass the threshold to be considered major media.\" However, as stated above, the Petitioner provided monthly visitor information, not circulation data as in the unpublished decision. She therefore has not established that findings in that decision are applicable in the matter at hand. In light of the above, the Petitioner has not established that she meets this criterion. This regulatory provision provides petitioners the opportunity to submit comparable evidence to establish the person's eligibility, if it is determined that the evidentiary criteria described in the regulations do not readily apply to the person's occupation. See generally 6 USCIS Policy Manual F.2(B)(l), https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual.

Although USCIS has approved 0-1 nonimmigrant visa petitions filed on behalf of the Petitioner, the prior approval does not preclude USCIS from denying an immigrant visa petition which is adjudicated based on a different standard - statute, regulations, and case law. USCIS is not precluded from denying a Form 1-140 immigrant petition after approving a prior nonimmigrant petition. See, e.g., Q Data Consulting, Inc. v. INS, 293 F.
